                    <h2>Immersive Technology Journey</h2>
                    <p>My time in the Netherlands focused on exploring immersive technologies beyond gaming, discovering practical applications in training, education, and team collaboration.</p>
                    <p>The experience at Fontys University in Eindhoven introduced me to a completely different learning approach - more independent and discussion-based compared to what I was used to in South Africa.</p>
                    <p>We worked on designing an IT solution for water quality issues at Hartbeespoort Dam in South Africa, which was personally meaningful as I live just 10 minutes away from Hartbeespoort town.</p>
                    <p>The Dutch approach to collaboration stood out - everyone contributes, but there's strong individual accountability culture where you're trusted to handle your piece without constant follow-up.</p>

                        <p>This visit tied in perfectly with our Immersive Tech module and gave me new ideas for how VR could connect to our project - specifically a training simulation for repairing or building IoT stations.</p>

                        <p>We visited the Waterschap in Tiel, where we got to see firsthand how water management is done in the Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>This gave us a general idea of what good water quality should be and how technology is applied on a national scale to monitor and improve water quality.</p>

                    <p>Before this module, my understanding of VR and AR was mostly limited to gaming and entertainment. Through the Immersive Tech workshops and the excursion to Enversed VR Center, I learned how these technologies can be applied in broader contexts such as training, education, and team collaboration.</p>
                    <p>I discovered their potential as tools for simulations, e.g., for training people to repair IoT stations - an idea I incorporated into our project concept.</p>

                    <p>Working with CyberTAG in a physical setting revealed new dimensions of international collaboration. The Dutch approach to teamwork - direct communication, individual accountability, and structured collaboration - was different from what I was used to.</p>
                    <p>I learned to adapt my communication style to be more direct while maintaining clarity, especially when explaining technical concepts to non-technical team members.</p>

                    <p>This experience taught me that true project leadership involves being both the technical anchor and the team's translator - making complex concepts accessible to everyone.</p>

                    <p>The culture shock was immediate - back in South Africa, life moves on four wheels, but in the Netherlands, the rhythm of the city is set by bikes swarming through dedicated lanes, trams, trains, and buses.</p>

                    <p>People in the Netherlands are direct but calm, saying exactly what they mean without adding extra layers of explanation. This was different from the more conversational style I'm used to back home.</p>

                    <p>I also helped visualize parts of our concept to make the presentation more effective and accessible to stakeholders.</p>
