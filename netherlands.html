                <h2>Travel to the Netherlands & First Impressions</h2>
                <p>My 29-hour journey and initial cultural experiences</p>

                    <div class="travel-text">
                        <p>My adventure to the Netherlands started with a marathon 29-hour journey from Johannesburg. It was a first for everything: my first ever flight and my first train ride. I was travelling with Jan, and we were both wide-eyed the whole way, I don't think I slept at all that whole night.</p>
                        <p>Our first stop was Doha. Let me tell you, that airport is something else, it's just massive. The views from the plane were incredible, from mountains in the Middle East to the tiny islands along the coast near Qatar. Our final part of the flight over the Netherlands was a patchwork of unbelievably green farms.</p>
                        <p>After a long flight, we hit a snag: nearly two hours stuck in Amsterdam's border control. Once we finally got through, we had to tackle the Dutch train system. We were pretty lost and even missed a connecting train, but some really kind locals patiently helped us figure it out.</p>
                        <p>We finally made it to Eindhoven and found our home for the next 3 weeks: the Stayokay Hostel. The four of us South Africans are sharing one room with four beds. It is a bit small and crowded, and sharing a room with near-strangers felt weird at first.</p>
                        <p>The culture shock was immediate and surreal. Back in South Africa, life moves on four wheels; your own car is a necessity. But here, the rhythm of the city is set by bikes swarming through dedicated lanes, trams, trains, and buses. The streets have a steady flow of people, but everyone is sealed off in their own space, a quiet, detached feeling that is completely different from the open, chatty buzz of life back in South Africa.</p>

                            <p>The first week at Fontys kicked off with intros and workshops. We got a tour of the ICT campus, which was way more teched-out than I'd imagined. Our main project is pretty cool; we have to design an IT solution for water quality issues back at Hartbeespoort Dam in South Africa which is in issue I am personally familiar with as I live about on a farm about 10 minutes away from Hartbeespoort town.</p>
                            <p>We jumped into the Immersive Tech module, got an intro to all sorts of tech, and had sessions on Intercultural Competencies that got me thinking about working in a global team. The Design Thinking workshop was a highlight, with a super hands-on session, tackling "how might we" questions and creating design challenges, which already helped our team come up with a concept for the solution. The week wrapped with group presentations, which was a nice way to see everyone's early ideas.</p>
                            <p>Most of our time was spent on research. As a team, we put together a deep-dive document, and I focused individually on the intro, background, problem statement, and objectives. For the individual research I looked into IoT and sensor networks.</p>

                            <p>Outside of class, the week was packed. We even started kickboxing lessons, which turned out to be an awesome way to blow off steam and try something completely new. Monday was an icebreaker at a student bar, Tuesday was pool night, and Wednesday we explored the city after group work. I skipped Thursday's student night to recharge, but by Friday I was checking out the Afghan mosque and wandering around. Saturday, the South African crew watched rugby at an Irish pub and then explored other parts of the city. On Sunday, we visited a fellow South African in Swalmen. He took us on a forest walk that crossed into Germany, showed us ancient Roman roads, and treated us to a boat ride before we hit Roermond to explore and try Dutch snacks like kipslom and frikadels.</p>

                            <p>The biggest cultural shift was the learning style. Fontys is all about independence, as the lecturers expect you to take initiative and collaborate, which is different from the more guided approach I'm used to. I really liked how interactive and discussion-based the classes were. But I'm not sure that it is a system that would work for me. It just seems like learning more complicated subjects like Calculus would be extremely difficult and chaotic.</p>
                            <p>The city itself moves differently too. Life here feels calm and organized. Everyone's minding their own business and usually have headphones on. It's a stark contrast to South Africa, where public spaces feel more social and alert. Even the 9 p.m. sunsets take getting used to!</p>

Everyone comes from different backgrounds, and not all of us speak English as a first language. I also learned how Fontys works, it's more independent and discussion-based compared to what I'm used to. The design thinking workshop was a big takeaway, showing me how to quickly turn ideas into concepts.</p>

                            <p>Week 2 started off strong with a presentation from Aquality. They introduced their water quality project; a boat packed with sensors that collects live data while floating across lakes and dams. Seeing such a practical application of tech was eye-opening, especially because it connects directly to the type of concept we're really interested in for our own project.</p>

                            <p>Next, we had another Introduction to IX session. This time we were given cards with prompts and challenges, and we had to brainstorm concepts using the design process. The session was equal parts creative chaos and structured problem-solving, and it really pushed us to think differently about how technology can solve real issues. This session was amazing; however I believe that it was something we should have done at the start of the module.</p>

                            <p>This week also included some amazing excursions. In Amsterdam, we experienced the "This is Holland" immersive flight simulator, which was honestly mind-blowing, it felt like we flew across the entire country in just minutes. We followed it up with a boat tour through the canals and some free time to explore the city's streets and energy.</p>
                            <p>We also visited Enversed, a virtual reality experience centre. It wasn't just fun, it also gave us a deeper look at how immersive technologies can be used beyond gaming, for training, education, and even team building. It tied in perfectly with our Immersive Tech module and gave me new ideas for how VR could connect to the project (a training simulation for repairing or building the IoT stations).</p>
                            <p>On Friday, we went on an excursion to the Waterschap in Tiel, where we got to see firsthand how water management is done in the Netherlands. This gave us a general idea of what good water quality should be.</p>

                            <p>Group work picked up momentum throughout the week. As a team, we developed three different solution concepts for our project. I took the lead on Concept 1, focusing on IoT sensor stations with a dashboard. My role was to research all the technical details, making sure our ideas weren't just creative but also realistic and clearly documented. It felt good to take charge of one part of the project concepts while also learning about the way my teammates work.</p>

                            <p>On a cultural level, I'm starting to adjust more to the rhythm of life here. Public transport is unbelievably punctual, and everything feels intentional and structured. During group activities, I noticed the Dutch approach to collaboration: everyone contributes, but there's a strong individual accountability culture, you're trusted to handle your piece without constant follow-up. Communication is another adjustment; people here are direct but calm, saying exactly what they mean without adding extra layers of explanation. It's different from the more conversational style I'm used to in back home.</p>

As a team, we worked on the full project plan, defining the scope, setting objectives, and mapping out our research questions, methods, and timeline. It was a lot to cover but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.</p>
                            <p>We also had to put together user profiles for potential stakeholders, like boaters; such as fishermen, tourists, and locals, so we could really picture who would be using our solution. After a lot of discussions and comparing the strengths of each concept, we settled on one idea to carry forward.</p>

                            <p>We had some fun outside of class too. One Tuesday night we had a student party at the girls' accommodation, which was a nice way to hang out casually and get to know people better. We also checked out the Feel Good Market, and a Market in Veldhoven where I picked up a few souvenirs and enjoyed the relaxed vibe. The highlight of the week had to be experiencing Die Nag at Strijp-S, an event full of music, lights, and energy. It was a completely different side of Eindhoven compared to the calm streets during the day.</p>

                    <div class="intercultural-body">
                        <h4>What?</h4>
                        <p>The first week is mostly about settling in and getting to know the project. We did a campus introduction, introduction to the Hartbeespoort Dam project brief, intercultural competencies, and a design thinking workshops. I also started my individual IoT research and the team in-depth research document. In the team, I mostly listen at first and then contribute structured points once I'm comfortable. The language barrier shows up sometimes, not everyone follows technical terms easily.</p>
                        
                        <h4>So what?</h4>
                        <p>This shows me two things: clear, simple communication is key in a mixed team, and my natural style of wait, then speaking is useful for structure but can mean I miss early input moments. I notice that Fontys has a more independent style of teaching compared to what I'm used to; lecturers expect you to figure things out, not spoon feed every step, like we are back home. Emotionally, I'm excited but also tired after the travel, which affects how engaged I feel.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Now what?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Speak earlier in brainstorming (at least one idea or question in the first 5 minutes).</li>
                            <li>Build a short IoT cheat sheet (summary) so everyone understands the basics.</li>
                            <li>Reflect weekly on my energy and engagement so I don't fade into the background when I'm tired.</li>

                    <div class="intercultural-body">
                        <h4>Situation:</h4>
                        <p>Week 2 is full of activities: Aquality's demo with their sensor boat, Amsterdam excursion, Enversed VR visit, Waterschap in Tiel, as well as group work and workshops where we developed three concepts.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Task:</h4>
                        <p>My task is to research and flesh out Concept 1: IoT sensor station and dashboard. I need to make sure that the concept is realistic, technically solid, and documented so the rest of the team understands it.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Action:</h4>
                        <p>I dove into IoT sensor options and data flow, thinking about how to make it simple but useful. I also write up the details for the group document. During excursions, I pay attention to how real-world projects (Aquality, Waterschap) keep solutions practical and focused.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Result:</h4>
                        <p>The 3 concepts comes together well, and my teammates rely on my input for the on concept 1 based of my research. But I realize I've spent too much time deep in details and not enough aligning my assumptions with the others, especially those focused on design or user experience.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                        <p>This experience taught me that true project leadership involves two key roles: being the technical anchor and the team's translator. I am confident in my ability to go deep and structure complex work, but I now see that my weakness is in bringing everyone along on that journey. For next time, I am committed to making my explanations more accessible, leveraging visuals, and regularly ensuring my non-technical colleagues are aligned and engaged.</p>

                    <div class="intercultural-body">
                        <h4>Description:</h4>
                        <p>Week 3 is about finalizing the project plan. As a team, we define scope, objectives, research questions, and risks. We create user profiles, pick one of the 3 concepts, and present our final project plan. I focused on the problem statement, community engagement, budget, and supporting the presentation. We also did a retrospective and 360 feedback session.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Feelings:</h4>
                        <p>At the start of the week, I feel the pressure of deadlines. It's a lot of detail to pull together. When my teammates give positive feedback on our group structure and reliability, I feel more confident. Social events (student party, Feel Good markets, Die Nag) give me balance and let me destress.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
                        <p>What went well: our group worked efficiently, we divided tasks fairly, and the final project plan looked solid. My writing and structuring skills helped the group move forward.</p>
                        <p>What didn't go so well: I stayed quiet too long during creative discussions, leaving the louder voices to set direction.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Analysis:</h4>
                        <p>This shows me my comfort zone is in refining and organizing, not in throwing ideas out quickly. It's a strength because it ensures quality, but it limits my influence on creative direction.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
                        <p>I learn that being effective in a team isn't just about doing your part well, it's also about timing and visibility. Waiting too long to speak means my ideas don't shape the conversation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Action plan:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In future projects ideation sessions, I should share ideas and questions within the as soon as they pop into my head.</li>
                            <li>Keep building on my strength in structure and research but balance it by stepping into the creative flow earlier.</li>
                            <li>Use visuals or short summaries when presenting technical content so everyone stays engaged.</li>

                    <p>Before the module, my understanding of VR and AR was mostly limited to gaming and entertainment. Through the Immersive Tech workshops and the excursion to Enversed VR Center, I learned how these technologies can be applied in broader contexts such as training, education, and team collaboration. I discovered their potential as tools for simulations, e.g., for training people to repair IoT stations.</p>

                    <p>Although I had worked on technical projects before, I had not applied structured design thinking methods. The "How Might We" workshops, user profiling exercises, and design challenges taught me how to focus on stakeholders' needs rather than just technical feasibility. For example, creating user profiles of fishermen, tourists, and locals gave me a new lens to align solutions with real-world users.</p>

                    <p>I knew cultural differences existed, but the Intercultural Competency sessions showed me practical tools for navigating them. I learned frameworks for recognizing how communication styles, work habits, and cultural expectations influence group dynamics. For example, I became more aware of the Dutch style of direct communication and punctuality, compared to the more conversational and flexible style I was used to in South Africa.</p>

                    <p>I did not know how advanced Dutch water management systems are. The excursion to the Waterschap in Tiel showed me how technology is applied on a national scale to monitor and improve water quality. This broadened my perspective on how IoT and data collection could be integrated into environmental solutions.</p>

                    <p>The Dutch academic system is very different from what I was used to in South Africa. At Fontys, lecturers gave us freedom to explore and expected initiative, which was sometimes uncomfortable but taught me to take more responsibility for my own learning. This independence was new to me, as I was more familiar with structured and guided teaching.</p>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Early Participation in Brainstorming</h4>
                    <p>I recognized that my natural style was to listen first and contribute structured input later. Through feedback sessions I realized that waiting too long reduced my impact during ideation.</p>

                        <h4>Transport & Mobility</h4>
                        <p>The culture shock was immediate - back in South Africa, life moves on four wheels, but in the Netherlands, the rhythm of the city is set by bikes swarming through dedicated lanes, trams, trains, and buses.</p>

                        <h4>Direct Communication</h4>
                        <p>People in the Netherlands are direct but calm, saying exactly what they mean without adding extra layers of explanation. This was different from the more conversational style I'm used to back home.</p>

                        <p>Public transport is unbelievably punctual, and everything feels intentional and structured. The Dutch approach to collaboration includes strong individual accountability - you're trusted to handle your piece without constant follow-up.</p>

                        <p>The streets have a steady flow of people, but everyone is sealed off in their own space, a quiet, detached feeling that is completely different from the open, chatty buzz of life back in South Africa.</p>

                        <p>Fontys emphasizes independence, with lecturers expecting students to take initiative and collaborate, which is different from the more guided approach I'm used to. The interactive, discussion-based classes required active participation.</p>
