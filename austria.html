                        <p>After wrapping up our time in Spain, it was time for the next leg of the minor, Austria, part three of the international program. We left from Lleida, Spain, heading towards Hagenberg, Austria, our new home for the next few weeks.</p>

                        <p>The day started smoothly. We took an early morning train ride from Lleida to Barcelona, it was quiet, everyone still half asleep. As we pulled into Barcelona Sants Station, everyone started grabbing their luggage, ready to hop off. We stepped onto the platform, relieved to finally stretch our legs, and that's when Marco froze. You could almost see the realization hit him. He forgot his laptop bag on the train.</p>

                        <p>Before any of us could react, he turned around and bolted back into the carriage just as the doors were about to close. The timing was straight out of a movie, except this time, the train didn't stay put. The doors shut and we stood there helplessly as the train rolled away with Marco still on board.</p>

                        <p>The next few minutes were chaos. We were standing there with all our luggage, half panicking, half laughing, trying to figure out how to get him back. Luckily, Marco managed to get off at the next stop and caught another train back to us. It felt like a lifetime, but in reality, it was maybe 45 minutes before he reappeared, holding the laptop bag triumphantly like he had just rescued a lost treasure.</p>

                        <p>Once the drama settled, we continued on our way a little more awake and a lot more cautious about checking our seats before leaving a train.</p>

                        <p>From Barcelona, we flew into Vienna, then caught a train to Linz. By the time we reached Hagenberg, it was already dark. None of us really knew where to get off the bus, and the Austrian countryside doesn't exactly have neon signs or city lights to help you figure it out. We must have looked completely lost because two other students approached us and helped us find our stop. Without them, we probably would've ended up in another town entirely.</p>

                                <h2>Week 1 in Austria:</h2>
                                <p>The first week in Austria began with an introduction to the IoT module and to FH Hagenberg. We started by meeting Volker, who immediately stood out: he has a whirlwind of energy, enthusiasm, and brilliant ideas, a true mad scientist, but in the best possible sense. His teaching style was dynamic, unpredictable, and exhilarating. He pushed us to experiment boldly, constantly challenging us to think outside the box while explaining the technical foundations with infectious passion. Every session felt like stepping into a lab where creativity and precision collided.</p>

                                <p>We quickly moved into hands-on lab work, testing individual sensors, learning how to connect them to the ESP32, and experimenting with basic readings through the serial monitor. Volker encouraged us to try unconventional approaches, never afraid of mistakes, framing each error as a learning opportunity. Once we had data flowing locally, we began setting up the MQTT broker and The Things Network (TTN), creating device profiles, registering endpoints, and ensuring messages could travel from the ESP through LoRaWAN into the network. The first successful transmission of sample payloads was a small but satisfying victory, made even more exciting by Volker's animated reactions and inventive troubleshooting suggestions.</p>

                                <p>On Thursday we took a break from the lab with a cultural visit to a museum in Linz (Ars Electronica) that combined technology and history. Returning to technical work, we set up the Raspberry Pi 4 as our local network hub, configuring it to connect to our private wireless network that we setup.</p>

                                <p>Outside of class, Austria immediately felt different from both the Netherlands and Spain. Hagenberg was small, quiet, and surrounded by hills and forests, a stark contrast to the busy streets of Eindhoven and Lleida. We explored the region, taking a trip to Gmunden, a picturesque lakeside town that felt like stepping into a postcard, calm water, small cafés, and snow-tipped mountains in the distance. After intense experimentation and problem-solving in the lab, it was the perfect chance to breathe and appreciate the surroundings. I also spent time hiking in the forests near campus, enjoying walks and moments of relaxation.</p>

                                <h2>Week 2 in Austria:</h2>
                                <p>The second week at FH Hagenberg focused on expanding the IoT project. A significant part of our work involved soldering sensors to build reliable hardware connections for the ESP32. This hands-on practice was essential for ensuring stable circuits, and it reinforced the importance of precision and patience in hardware assembly.</p>

                                <p>We soldered multiple sensors with the ESP32, paying attention not only to individual readings but also to how these data streams interacted within the network. We refined the MQTT broker and TTN setup, optimizing the payload structure and experimenting with topic hierarchies to ensure reliable and efficient data flow. Testing different configurations and analysing the results helped improve the overall system performance.</p>

                                <p>We also worked on data storage and visualization. Setting up the MariaDB database and connecting it to the Raspberry Pi hub allowed us to collect real-time sensor data. Debugging sessions were frequent but rewarding, as every problem solved added to our understanding of system behaviour. By the end of the week, the data pipeline was functional: sensors feeding data into the ESP32, through TTN, arriving at the broker, and being stored and visualized on the RasberryPi.</p>

                                <p>Outside of class, we had the chance to explore Austria and even venture beyond its borders, combining adventure with cultural experiences. In Salzburg, we wandered through its historic streets, admiring the architecture, charming squares, and ornate churches. We visited key landmarks, explored local cafés, and soaked in the atmosphere of the city where music and history are so deeply intertwined. Walking along the Salzach River and through the old town, it felt like stepping back in time while still enjoying a lively modern city.</p>

                                <p>Our hike up the Austrian Alps was a thrilling challenge, though the mountain ultimately got the better of us. We had set our sights on reaching the snow at the summit, but the steep paths and rugged terrain proved tougher than expected. Even though we didn't make it to the top, the hike was unforgettable, the chilly mountain air, stunning views, and the feeling of pushing ourselves physically made it an invigorating experience. Each pause to catch our breath offered breathtaking glimpses of the surrounding peaks and valleys, reminding us that sometimes the journey itself is just as rewarding as reaching the destination.</p>

                                <p>To round off the week, we took a trip to Prague, a city brimming with history and character. Walking across the Charles Bridge at sunrise, exploring the Old Town, and seeing the Astronomical Clock in action were unforgettable experiences. The city's architecture made every street feel like a storybook. Beyond sightseeing, we visited markets, tried traditional cuisine, and enjoyed the rhythm of life in a vibrant European city.</p>

                                <h2>Week 3 in Austria:</h2>
                                <p>The third week at FH Hagenberg focused on completing the IoT project and preparing it for realworld deployment. The main priorities were connecting all sensors to the front-end navigation system and assembling the entire device into a waterproof box.</p>

                                <p>Integrating the sensors with the front end allowed real-time data from the ESP32 to be displayed directly on the boat navigation interface, creating a fully functional system. Testing this setup involved careful coordination between the sensors, MQTT broker, TTN, and the navigation interface to ensure that data was accurate, consistent, and updated in real time.</p>

                                <p>The waterproof housing was equally critical. We drilled precise holes in the box for each sensor and carefully positioned the wires and devices to maintain stability and proper alignment. Once everything was in place, we sealed the holes using a hot glue gun and then sealed the box itself, testing to make sure it was fully waterproof.</p>

                                <p>Other work included minor soldering and troubleshooting to ensure that all of the connections were stable and that data flowed reliably through the system. By the end of the week, the IoT network was fully operational, feeding live data to the front-end navigation system and securely enclosed in a waterproof housing.</p>

                            The first week in Austria was all about adapting to a new environment and diving into the IoT module at FH Hagenberg. We met our lecturer, Volker. His sessions encouraged experimentation and creativity, making the technical work engaging and hands-on. During the week, we focused on setting up and testing individual sensors, configuring the ESP32, and establishing data transmission through LoRaWAN and The Things Network (TTN). Outside of class, the experience of living in Hagenberg stood out. The town was much quieter and more rural than the cities we had stayed in before. The calm atmosphere, surrounded by forests and hills, offered a very different pace of life compared to the Netherlands and Spain. We also visited Linz for a cultural trip to Ars Electronica, blending art, technology, and science.</p>

                            <p><strong>So What?</strong><br>
                            This first week highlighted how different teaching and cultural environments can influence learning and teamwork. Volker's approach emphasized exploration over instruction, which encouraged me to take more ownership of my learning and not wait for step-by-step direction. It also reinforced how important it is to be flexible and comfortable with uncertainty when working in new academic settings.</p>

                            <p><strong>Now What?</strong><br>
                            - I naturally took the lead during this module because I had more technical knowledge of IoT systems than the rest of the group. This helped keep the project organized and ensured that we met our technical goals efficiently.<br>
                            - Going forward, I want to strengthen my leadership by focusing on knowledge sharing, and helping others understand the systems more. This will make collaboration smoother and more balanced.<br>
                            - Reflecting on this experience, I've realized that leadership in a multicultural environment means combining technical competence with patience, clear communication, and adaptability. I plan to carry these lessons into future group projects.</p>

                            <h3>Week 2 — STARR Reflection:</h3>
                            <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
                            The second week in Austria was centred around advancing the IoT project. We moved from initial testing to building a fully functional system, soldering sensors, refining the MQTT and TTN setup, configuring data storage on the Raspberry Pi, and ensuring that all components worked together reliably. Outside of class, we also explored Satzburg and hiked in the Austrian Alps, which offered a refreshing cultural balance after long hours in the lab.</p>

                            <p><strong>Task:</strong><br>
                            My main responsibility was to lead the technical setup and integration of the sensors with the ESP32 and the data pipeline. This involved ensuring accurate sensor readings, managing communication through LoRaWAN and MQTT, and linking the system to our MariaDB database. Because I had more IoT experience than most of the group, I naturally took the lead in planning, troubleshooting, and guiding others through the setup process.</p>

                            <p><strong>Action:</strong><br>
                            We focused on a sensor calibration, communication testing, and database configuration. Marco and I also ran regular checks to make sure our system components stayed synchronized and that everyone understood how their part fit into the larger structure. When issues arose, especially with inconsistent data or network delays, I worked hands-on with teammates to debug and explain the reasoning behind each fix.</p>

                            <p><strong>Result:</strong><br>
                            By the end of the week, our IoT system was fully functional. All sensors were calibrated, data successfully flowed through LoRaWAN and MQTT to the Raspberry Pi database, and visualization on the front-end began to take shape. The group became more confident with the technical aspects as well, and our workflow became smoother as everyone better understood the data chain.</p>

                            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
                            This week highlighted how crucial structure and precision are in IoT development. Small configuration errors, such as wiring short circuits, can disrupt the entire data chain. The process taught me the importance of systematic testing and layer-by-layer verification before scaling up. I also realized the value of designing with maintainability in mind, building a setup that others can easily replicate, debug, and expand. Overall, this week strengthened my understanding of end-to-end IoT system design and reinforced the importance of consistency, documentation, and methodical validation in technical project work.</p>

                            <h3>Week 3 — John's Model of Structured Reflection:</h3>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                            Week 3 at FH Hagenberg was focused on completing and finalizing the IoT project. Our main goals were to integrate all sensors into the navigation front-end, assemble the full device inside a waterproof housing, and ensure the system was stable and reliable in real-world conditions. We worked on synchronizing data between the ESP32, MQTT broker, and the front-end app, while also troubleshooting communication issues and hardware inconsistencies. I led much of the final assembly process, from organizing the internal wiring, drilling, and sealing the waterproof box to verifying that all sensors transmitted accurate data during testing.</p>

                            <p><strong>Feelings:</strong><br>
                            At the start of the week, I felt both focused and slightly tense, we had a clear goal but little room for mistakes. I was confident in my understanding of the system, but I also felt the pressure of ensuring everything came together seamlessly before the final demonstration. As we progressed and saw live data displayed on the navigation app, that pressure shifted into pride and satisfaction. Seeing our system function as a complete IoT chain, from sensors to front-end, was incredibly rewarding after weeks of troubleshooting.</p>

                            <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong><br>
                            What went well: Our team worked efficiently under time constraints, and my prior experience with IoT hardware helped prevent major errors during assembly. The system ran smoothly, data transmission was reliable, and the waterproof housing turned out successfully. The group trusted my guidance on final configuration steps, and that trust kept morale high and work flowing.<br>
                            What didn't go so well: We underestimated how long soldering and waterproofing would take. Some steps, like sealing and retesting the sensors after enclosure, were rushed. I also realized that while I focused heavily on ensuring technical precision, we could have spent more time refining the visual presentation of the data for the front-end interface.</p>

                            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
                            This experience reinforced how critical the integration phase is in IoT development. Even small errors in wiring, code synchronization, or sealing can compromise the entire system. The process also showed me the importance of balancing technical execution with presentation, the final impression depends not only on how well the system works but also on how clearly it communicates its purpose. I learned that strong preparation, time management, and clear testing protocols are essential when transitioning from development to deployment.</p>

                            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                            By the end of the week, I felt proud of the system we built. The project proved that a small team, with clear coordination and hands-on focus, can produce a functional IoT network in just a few weeks. Personally, I gained deeper confidence in managing complex technical builds from start to finish and ensuring every subsystem works cohesively.</p>

                <!-- Intercultural Competencies Tab -->
                <div class="tab-content" id="intercultural-comp">
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h2>Intercultural Competencies:</h2>
                        <p>The Netherlands has a culture that is very structured and task oriented. People tend to follow schedules closely, stick to clear roles, and focus on efficiency and precision. Meetings are usually short and to the point, and work is approached with careful planning. Spontaneous ideas and informal social interaction are less common during work time, as the priority is on completing tasks effectively.</p>

                        <p>In Spain, the culture is more relaxed and social. People take time to connect personally and enjoy conversations before or alongside work. Flexibility is common, and rules are often treated as guidelines rather than strict requirements. This creates a more informal, energetic atmosphere, where creativity and collaboration are encouraged. Decisions are often made through discussion and consensus, rather than following a strict hierarchy or timetable.</p>

                        <p>South African culture shares similarities with Spain in terms of social connection and flexibility. People value personal interaction, community, and informal communication. Relationships are important in daily life and in teamwork, and there is a balance between following plans and adapting to changing circumstances. Like in Spain, this creates a lively and adaptable environment, where collaboration and problem-solving often involve negotiation and discussion rather than strict rules.</p>

                        <p>Austria, on the other hand, combines structure and formality with a strong respect for tradition and quality. People value organization, punctuality, and precision, similar to the Netherlands, but with a slightly more formal and hierarchical tone. Work is approached in a systematic and methodical way, and there is a clear separation between professional and personal life. Hierarchies are respected, and decisions typically follow established procedures and expert input rather than spontaneous discussion.</p>

                        <p>Communication in the Netherlands tends to be direct and straightforward. People value clarity, honesty, and efficiency in how information is shared. In Spain, communication is generally warmer and more expressive. People use conversation to build relationships, and interactions often include humour, gestures, and personal anecdotes. Listening and dialogue are important for reaching agreement. In South Africa, communication is also friendly and relational, often combining directness with warmth and respect. People value mutual understanding and tend to adapt their tone depending on the situation. In Austria, communication is polite, respectful, and often more formal. People choose their words carefully and maintain a courteous tone, especially in professional settings. While honesty is appreciated, it is balanced with diplomacy to avoid conflict or misunderstanding.</p>

                        <p>Problem-solving and decision-making also differ between these cultures. In the Netherlands, issues are usually addressed quickly and pragmatically, with a focus on practical solutions. In Spain and South Africa, solutions are often negotiated through discussion and compromise, taking into account relationships and group harmony. This allows for flexibility and creativity but can take more time to reach a final decision. Austria leans toward careful analysis and thorough evaluation before acting. Decisions may take longer, as accuracy and long-term stability are prioritized over speed. The Austrian approach emphasizes precision, planning, and maintaining high standards in both process and outcome.</p>

                <div class="tab-content" id="null-measurement">
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h2>Null Measurement:</h2>

                        <h3>What I Already Knew:</h3>
                        <p>Before arriving in Austria, I already had a strong foundation in coding. I had done some practical work with IoT sensors before, so I already understood how to connect and configure basic sensors to microcontrollers. I also understood networks conceptually and had a general idea of how data flows between devices and databases. However, my experience was mostly limited to smaller systems; I hadn't yet worked with a complete IoT stack that involved large-scale data pipelines or multiple communication layers.</p>

                        <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
                        <p>- The complete IoT development process: from data acquisition and sensor calibration to network transmission and database storage.<br>
                        During this module, I experienced the full IoT workflow from start to finish. We began by calibrating individual sensors (pH, temperature, turbidity, TDS, and GPS) to ensure accurate readings. I learned how crucial correct calibration and data scaling are for reliable measurements. From there, I helped configure the ESP32 microcontroller to capture the data and send it through LoRaWAN to The Things Network (TTN), where it could be processed and pushed to our MQTT broker. Finally, we stored and organized the data in a MariaDB database on the Raspberry Pi, completing the full end-to-end IoT chain. This experience gave me a clear, practical understanding of how sensor data travels through each layer of an IoT system.</p>

                        <p>- How to integrate multiple protocols effectively (LoRaWAN → TTN → MQTT → MariaDB).<br>
                        I learned how to make multiple communication protocols work together seamlessly. LoRaWAN was used to transmit low-power, long-range data from the ESP32. TTN acted as the network layer, receiving and forwarding the messages. We then configured an MQTT broker Snode C to handle live data transfer between the network and our Raspberry Pi database. Understanding how each protocol interacts, and where potential issues or data mismatches could occur, was one of the most valuable technical lessons of the project. It also helped me understand how IoT systems rely on layered architectures to maintain reliability and scalability.</p>

                        <h3>What I Improved:</h3>
                        <p>- Attention to detail: recognizing how tiny physical or code errors can break an entire system.</p>
                        <p>- Collaboration under pressure: dividing work efficiently and relying on others' strengths.</p>
                        <p>- Resilience: staying calm and focused through hardware issues and tight deadlines.</p>
                        <p>- Critical thinking: learning from Volker's approach of questioning assumptions rather than accepting quick fixes.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h2>What I learned:</h2>
                        <p>My time in Austria was a major step in connecting theory to practice and understanding how all the layers of an IoT system work together. Over the three weeks, I learned not only the technical aspects of building and integrating IoT systems but also the value of precision, patience, and problem-solving in a real-world environment.</p>

                        <p>At first, I focused on understanding how data travels through an IoT network, from sensor to microcontroller, through LoRaWAN and TTN, into the MQTT broker, and finally to a local database. I learned that even small misconfigurations, such as an incorrect device ID or topic structure, could disrupt the entire system. This experience taught me the importance of attention to detail and thorough testing at every step.</p>

                        <p>As the project progressed, soldering and hardware assembly became central to my learning. Building and stabilizing sensor circuits showed me how critical careful hands-on work is in ensuring reliability. I developed patience and accuracy when soldering and wiring, realizing that physical connections are just as important as the code that runs them.</p>

                        <p>Later, integrating our sensors with the front-end boat navigation system gave me a new appreciation for system design. It was the first time I saw how raw data from multiple sensors could feed into a live interface, forming a complete and interactive solution. Managing real-time data streams and ensuring accurate communication between the ESP32, MQTT, TTN, and Raspberry Pi reinforced how interconnected every part of an IoT ecosystem truly is.</p>

                        <p>Finally, assembling the complete device into a waterproof box tied everything together. Drilling precise holes for sensors, arranging the wiring, sealing openings with a hot glue gun, and testing for waterproofing taught me the importance of practical design and physical protection in IoT deployments. It was a reminder that even the most advanced technology must be built to withstand real-world conditions.</p>

                        <p>Beyond technical growth, I learned the value of teamwork, adaptability, and clear communication. Working in an international group with different backgrounds and approaches taught me to express ideas clearly, listen actively, and stay flexible when plans changed.</p>

                        <h2>My Contributions to the Project:</h2>
                        <p>My contributions to the project covered the full development process, from assembling and testing the first hardware prototypes to completing the final, fully waterproofed version of the device.</p>

                        <p>I began by building the initial hardware setup, where I connected each sensor individually to the ESP32. This stage focused on confirming that every sensor operated correctly on its own, producing accurate and stable readings. It allowed me to identify the ideal wiring configurations, signal behaviour, and data formats for each sensor type before combining them into a larger system.</p>

                        <p>Once each sensor was individually tested, I moved on to building the combined prototype using a breadboard. This version brought all sensors together into a single, integrated circuit. It was an essential step in testing how the sensors interacted within the same network, how they transmitted data, and affected one another's readings. The breadboard version also allowed for flexible reconfiguration, which helped troubleshoot any communication or signal stability issues that appeared during early testing.</p>

                        <p>After achieving a stable setup, I designed and constructed a more robust and mobile version of the device on a printed circuit board (PCB). I soldered each component carefully, ensuring firm and reliable connections that would withstand handling and outdoor conditions. This soldered version represented a significant step forward in durability and portability compared to the breadboard prototype.</p>

                        <p>In addition to the hardware work, I created the original SQL script used to structure and manage the storage of sensor data. This database setup formed the foundation for logging readings and later integrating the data into the project's front-end system.</p>

                        <p>I also worked on assembling the complete device inside a waterproof enclosure. I drilled holes in the box to fit the sensors and wires, ensuring proper alignment and accessibility. Once everything was positioned correctly, I sealed the holes and joints using a hot glue gun, carefully checking that the enclosure was watertight to protect the electronics during testing and operation.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, I contributed to developing and refining the code used to calibrate and configure the sensors. This included adjusting parameters to ensure accurate readings, synchronizing the sensors with the network, and testing the overall responsiveness of the system.</p>

                        <p>Through each stage, my contributions helped the team move from concept to a durable, mobile IoT system capable of accurate data collection and real-world deployment.</p>

                        <h2>Module Overview:</h2>
                        
                        <h3>IoT Process & Technical Development:</h3>
                        <p>This module focused on IoT integration, we took our concept and built a complete working system from the ground up. Our setup consisted of:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Microcontrollers – ESP32 and Raspberry Pi 4</li>
                            <li>Sensors – Combined pH & temperature sensor module (Logo Raenaer V2), turbidity sensor, TDS sensor, GPS (GT U7)</li>
                            <li>Network & Communication – LoRaWAN, TTN, MQTT broker (Snode C)</li>
                            <li>Database – MariaDB on the Raspberry Pi 4</li>
                            <li>Software & Front-End – React + TypeScript for the navigation app, C++ on the ESP and Snode C for the devices</li>
                            <li>Key Libraries – DallasTemperature, OneWire, LoRaWAN_ESP32, RadioLib, TinyGPSPlus, TinyGPSPlus_ESP32</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>All devices were powered directly via USB connection to laptops.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of this setup was to create a low-cost, decentralized system for monitoring water quality, with data accessible to boaters and local authorities. By combining IoT sensors and LoRaWAN, the system can gather live environmental data without the need for constant human oversight or expensive infrastructure.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How</h3>
                        <p>We followed a layered approach:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sensor Layer – We calibrated and tested each sensor individually, ensuring accurate readings for pH, temperature, turbidity, GPS location, and TDS.</li>
                            <li>Network Layer – The ESP32 transmitted sensor data through the LoRaWAN to the TTN (The Things Network), which then pushed it to our MQTT broker (Snode C).</li>
                            <li>Database Layer – Our broker fed data into a MariaDB database that is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4, which is connected via our private Wi-Fi network called CyberTAG.</li>
                            <li>Application Layer – A React navigation app displayed environmental and positional data for boaters.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>What</h3>
                        <p>By the end of the module, we had successfully calibrated and connected all of the sensors. We achieved live data flow through the full stack, from the physical sensors to the MQTT broker and database. Our final demonstration showed this process in real-time, proving that the entire IoT chain functioned correctly.</p>
                        
                        <p>This was my first time managing a full IoT pipeline independently, from hardware and software integration to database linking. I learned how critical small configuration details are, and how hardware and software must align perfectly for the system to work.</p>
